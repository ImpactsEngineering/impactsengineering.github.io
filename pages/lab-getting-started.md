# Part 0: Getting Started

Each of you has an Arduino kit which includes an Arduino circuit board and a variety of components. Please take a few minutes to look through your components to figure out what is there. You may not use everything that you have in this lab, but it is good to know what is there for future projects you may decide to complete.

Next, you'll want to install the software programming environment used with the Arduino. The software, called an IDE (integrated development environment), allows you to write code which will then be uploaded to the processor on the Arduino board. The main organization provides [two methods for communicating with your Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
1. The Arduino Web Editor: Provides an online environment for editing code and you only install a small program which helps connect the Arduino to this online environment. The strength is that it is always up to date and you can access your code from any device. The downside is that you need an internet connection to program your Arduino.
2. The Arduino IDE: This is a piece of software that you install on your computer to communicate with your Arduino. This method doesn't require an internet connection to work and is probably the more robust way to work with your Arduino. If you have code that you don't want to accidentally lose, make sure you are backing up your files!

Whichever method you choose to use, make sure you can [get successfully connected to your Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/ArduinoUno).
