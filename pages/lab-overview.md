# Lab Overview

The lab portion of this course involves two primary components, learning mechatronics and programming using the [Arduino platform](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) and a design project which also involves using the Arduino platform.

## Phase 1: Introduction (approximately 3 weeks)

The first few weeks of lab involve getting to know the Arduino platform through a series of lab activities:
- Part 0: [Getting Started](/lab/getting-started)
- Part 1: [Blink an LED](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink)
- Part 2: 
- Part 3: 
- Part 4: 
- Part 5: 
- Part 6: [Design a custom circuit](/lab/custom-circuit)

For each of Parts 1-5, please make sure you do the following:
1. Construct the electrical circuit as shown in the tutorial.
1. Load the provided code onto your Arduino, see if it runs as expected.
1. Walk through the code line-by-line. What does each line do?
1. Now edit the code to make it do something different. What did you change and why? Did the change have the intended effect?

## Phase 2: Design Project
