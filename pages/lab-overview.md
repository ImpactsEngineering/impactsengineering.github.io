# Lab Overview

The lab portion of this course involves two primary components, learning mechatronics and programming using the [Arduino platform](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) and a design project which also involves using the Arduino platform. Note that there are a lot of great tutorials for the Arduino online. A few specifics that we'd like you to complete are linked below. Here are some links to a variety of others: [Arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/BuiltInExamples), [ARDX](http://www.oomlout.com/a/products/ardx/), [Smraza](https://mega.nz/#F!F1gj0Y7L!vrf91AD2b5OowYc43dSR7Q)

## Phase 1: Introduction (approximately 3 weeks)

The first few weeks of lab involve getting to know the Arduino platform through a series of lab activities:
- Part 0: [Getting Started](/lab/getting-started)
- Part 1: [Blink an LED](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink)
- Part 2: [LED Array](https://mega.nz/#F!F1gj0Y7L!vrf91AD2b5OowYc43dSR7Q!J04wWLwA)
- Part 3: [Potentiometer and Servo](https://mega.nz/#F!F1gj0Y7L!vrf91AD2b5OowYc43dSR7Q!Z4AXAD6S)
- Part 4: [Stepper Motor](https://mega.nz/#F!F1gj0Y7L!vrf91AD2b5OowYc43dSR7Q!98JRmZJK)
- Part 5: [Ultrasonic Range Sensor](https://mega.nz/#F!F1gj0Y7L!vrf91AD2b5OowYc43dSR7Q!0o5GjQbR)
- Part 6: [Design a custom circuit](/lab/custom-circuit)

For each of Parts 1-5, please make sure you do the following:
1. Construct the electrical circuit as shown in the tutorial.
1. Load the provided code onto your Arduino, see if it runs as expected.
1. Walk through the code line-by-line. What does each line do?
1. Now edit the code to make it do something different. What did you change and why? Did the change have the intended effect?
