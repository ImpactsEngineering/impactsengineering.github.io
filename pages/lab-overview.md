# Lab Overview

The lab portion of this course involves two primary components, learning mechatronics and programming using the [Arduino platform](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction) and a design project which also involves using the Arduino platform.

## Phase 1: Introduction (approximately 3 weeks)

The first few weeks of lab involve getting to know the Arduino platform through a series of lab activities:
- Part 0: [Getting Started](/lab/getting-started)
- Part 1: [Blink an LED](/lab/blink-an-led)
- Part 2: 
- Part 3: 
- Part 4: 
- Part 5: 
- Part 6: [Design a custom circuit](/lab/custom-circuit)
