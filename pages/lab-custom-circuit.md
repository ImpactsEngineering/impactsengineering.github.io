## Part 6: Design a Custom circuit

This portion of the lab activities is intended to allow you to use some creativity. You are expected to design a custom circuit that performs two complementary tasks. This should not be equivalent to something you have already completed during one of the earlier activities.

Thnk about how you might design a circuit that accepts a user input and then uses that input to create an output, with some sort of processing in the middle.
